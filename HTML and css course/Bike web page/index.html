<p>296 cm3 39PS fuel injected parallel twin Engine
    Fine-atomising injectors (60 μm) ensure ideal fuel delivery at all rpm. Designed for rider-friendly response, the Ninja 300’s fuel-injected Parallel Twin engine delivers smooth, responsive torque at low and medium rpm and hard-hitting acceleration at high rpm. The engine offers significantly stronger torque and power at all rpm, putting the Ninja 300 in a class of its own. Complementing the enhanced engine performance, racing-derived clutch technology offers a lighter clutch lever pull and a back-torque limiting function, while heat management technology like the radiator fan cover directs heat away from the rider, significantly improving rider comfort</p>
    <p>Dual Throttle Valves
        Similar to the Ninja ZX-10R, dual throttle valves give precise control of intake air, resulting in linear throttle response across the rpm range. Dual throttle valves also contribute to combustion efficiency, and hence engine performance as well as favourable fuel consumption. Larger main throttle valves are and sub-throttle valves help flow a greater volume of air, contributing to the increased engine performance. Fine-atomising injectors with a droplet size of only 60 μm contribute to combustion efficiency.</p>
